# IoT-based-Temp.-and-Humidity-monitoring-and-controlling-system

IoT based Smart Seed Storage.

<h3>Description</h3>
<div>This is a agriculture research project. Our developed system collect Temperature and Humidity data form seed store room by sensors and send it to firebase database through the internet. Via mobile or computer this data can be monitored and by sending signal, the temperature and humidity of seed storage could be control. Also, we storing statistics data for further analysis. By using C++ programming language I developed control program. Here, Java is used for develop mobile application. Here we used Firebase database for storing realtime data.
